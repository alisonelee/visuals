# Seasonal Visuals 

## Overview 
Though I’m a full-time student here in New York City, home base for me is in California. And for the past four years, I’ve been splitting my time between the two. This project will focus on the three out of four seasons I spend in New York for school. My aim is to manifest the feelings I experience each season through visuals and sounds that are personal to my story. 

Inspired by a visual album, the three full-browser drawings will each feature a season– fall, winter, or spring. The three will be displayed as “albums” on a main index page, from which the user can choose to delve into each season in whichever order they please. The drawings will incorporate a level of interactivity, allowing the user to change the scene or at least bring in different elements to it by toggling different factors that have effects on me in reality, such as the weather (haha). The elements will be a mix of vector and raster graphics, and various media elements will be embedded as well. I plan on having pixel manipulation, HTML canvas, and Javascript play major roles in bringing this project to life. 

### Drawing 1 – Fall
Fall is generally a very good time for me. Still on a summer’s high, I always feel inspired coming back to the city for another school year, so I want this drawing to resemble a visual moodboard— something that sparks and breeds creativity. Interactive elements will be added the same way as you would tack a photo onto a wall.

### Drawing 2 – Winter
Winters are tough on me, and feel extremely prolonged. In contrast to the previous board, I’d like for this drawing to look purposefully minimal to symbolize the cold, barren winter months. I will most likely incorporate some sort of media– maybe a looping video clip– to represent the drowned out days, and will also use pixel manipulation to get the corresponding color grading to help portray the same idea.

### Drawing 3 – Spring
Spring is a little unexpected. There are definitely some trying times ahead, but there are some surprisingly pleasant days sprinkled here and there too. So, I plan on incorporating JavaScript that applies CSS transition/animation without the user directly interacting with the elements to play the part of the persistent winter weather, but will also give a balance of control to the user. I think spring still puts up a good fight, but you also have a bit more of a spring in your step too.
